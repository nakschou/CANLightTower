# CANLightTower

## Some Questions

1. Should we format the Data into 6 chars in the rightmost elements of the stmp to implement the Color-Time-Repetitions functionality
2. Does _String readString = buf;   //Turn CAN message into readable string_ insert the delimiters or is that set by the sending CAN "Master"
